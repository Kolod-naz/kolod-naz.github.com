      <h3>This is one of the most amazing website designs:</h3>
    <ul>

<li><a href="http://www.because-recollection.com/major-lazer">WEBSITE-1</a></li> <p>This website is really cool when it comes to explore music, it has different features and different ways to listen to each singer.</p> 
<li><a href="http://sonsofgallipoli.com/#!/doc/2/54f3864f46530doc1189845887">WEBSITE-2</a></li> <p>This website is a book website that comes in two languages. Turkish and English, what make this website really cool, is the new experience of how you read and see a book, it was fun to and I felt excited about the different ideas in presenting each chapter.</p>
<li><a href="http://imm-g-prod.com/acme/marine-and-petrochemical">WEBSITE-3</a> </li> <p>What I liked about this website is the matching between the background colors, the fonts and the pictures. It's simple but in a creative way. </p>
